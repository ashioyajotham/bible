      " The story of the transformation of water into wine at the marriage feast in Cana (John 2:1-11) is a miracle performed by Jesus. At this marriage celebration, the wine served ran out, and Jesus' mother, Mary, told him the problem. Jesus responded by having the servants fill six stone water jars with water and take some to the master of the feast, who found it had turned into wine. When the governor of the feast tasted it, he praised the new wine for being better than the wine that had run out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The moral of this story has multiple layers and interpretations, but here are a few key aspects: \n",
      "\n",
      "1. Jesus as the provider: This miracle demonstrates Jesus' power and his care for the needs of people, particularly in times of scarcity. Jesus met an urgent need in a moment of celebration, providing for the couple in a miraculous way. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. Transformation: Jesus brings about transformation in our lives. Just as he transformed water into wine, Jesus can bring about spiritual transformation in us. This can be seen in the process of accepting him as Lord and experiencing a change in our hearts, as well as the transformation of our behaviors and attitudes to be more aligned with God's purpose. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. Faith and obedience: Mary's instruction to the servants to obey Jesus' command, even though it seemed odd to draw out water in the midst of a celebration, models faith and obedience. This demonstrates that we, too, are called to have faith in Jesus and obey his instructions, even when they seem unusual or difficult to understand. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. The abundance of Jesus: Jesus provides abundantly. The wine was not just any wine but was the best wine, and the jars held a surpassing amount, indicating the superabundant nature of Jesus' provision and grace. \n",
      "\n",
      "This story challenges us to have faith in Jesus, trust in his provisions, and be open to the transformation he works in our lives. \n",
      "{'John+2&version': {'story': ' Jesus Changes Water Into Wine2 On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee.(A) Jesus’ mother(B) was there, 2 and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding. 3 When the wine was gone, Jesus’ mother said to him, “They have no more wine.” 4 “Woman,(C) why do you involve me?”(D) Jesus replied. “My hour(E) has not yet come.” 5 His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.”(F) 6 Nearby stood six stone water jars, the kind used by the Jews for ceremonial washing,(G) each holding from twenty to thirty gallons. 7 Jesus said to the servants, “Fill the jars with water”; so they filled them to the brim. 8 Then he told them, “Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet.”They did so, 9 and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine.(H) He did not realize where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside 10 and said, “Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink; but you have saved the best till now.” 11 What Jesus did here in Cana of Galilee was the first of the signs(I) through which he revealed his glory;(J) and his disciples believed in him.(K) 12 After this he went down to Capernaum(L) with his mother(M) and brothers(N) and his disciples. There they stayed for a few days. Jesus Clears the Temple Courts(O)13 When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover,(P) Jesus went up to Jerusalem.(Q) 14 In the temple courts he found people selling cattle, sheep and doves,(R) and others sitting at tables exchanging money.(S) 15 So he made a whip out of cords, and drove all from the temple courts, both sheep and cattle; he scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables. 16 To those who sold doves he said, “Get these out of here! Stop turning my Father’s house(T) into a market!” 17 His disciples remembered that it is written: “Zeal for your house will consume me.”(U) 18 The Jews(V) then responded to him, “What sign(W) can you show us to prove your authority to do all this?”(X) 19 Jesus answered them, “Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days.”(Y) 20 They replied, “It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and you are going to raise it in three days?” 21 But the temple he had spoken of was his body.(Z) 22 After he was raised from the dead, his disciples recalled what he had said.(AA) Then they believed the scripture(AB) and the words that Jesus had spoken. 23 Now while he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Festival,(AC) many people saw the signs(AD) he was performing and believed(AE) in his name. 24 But Jesus would not entrust himself to them, for he knew all people. 25 He did not need any testimony about mankind,(AF) for he knew what was in each person.(AG) FootnotesJohn 2:4 The Greek for Woman does not denote any disrespect.

Send the crowds away, so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food.” 16 Jesus replied, “They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat.” 17 “We have here only five loaves(E) of bread and two fish,” they answered. 18 “Bring them here to me,” he said. 19 And he directed the people to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves.(F) Then he gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people. 20 They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. 21 The number of those who ate was about five thousand men, besides women and children.

Bring the best robe(I) and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger(J) and sandals on his feet. 23 Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let’s have a feast and celebrate. 24 For this son of mine was dead and is alive again;(K) he was lost and is found.’ So they began to celebrate.(L) 25 “Meanwhile, the older son was in the field. When he came near the house, he heard music and dancing. 26 So he called one of the servants and asked him what was going on. 27 ‘Your brother has come,’ he replied, ‘and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.’ 28 “The older brother became angry(M) and refused to go in. So his father went out and pleaded with him. 29 But he answered his father, ‘Look! All these years I’ve been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends. 30 But when this son of yours who has squandered your property(N) with prostitutes(O) comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!’ 31 “‘My son,’ the father said, ‘you are always with me, and everything I have is yours. 32 But we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’”(P) Read full chapter Cross referencesLuke 15:11 : Mt 21:28 Luke 15:12 : Dt 21:17 Luke 15:12 : ver 30 Luke 15:13 : ver 30; Lk 16:1 Luke 15:15 : Lev 11:7 Luke 15:18 : Lev 26:40; Mt 3:2 Luke 15:20 : Ge 45:14, 15; 46:29; Ac 20:37 Luke 15:21 : Ps 51:4 Luke 15:22 : Zec 3:4; Rev 6:11 Luke 15:22 : Ge 41:42 Luke 15:24 : Eph 2:1, 5; 5:14; 1Ti 5:6 Luke 15:24 : ver 32 Luke 15:28 : Jnh 4:1 Luke 15:30 : ver 12, 13 Luke 15:30 : Pr 29:3 Luke 15:32 : ver 24; Mal 3:17 ', 'questions': ['Where did it happen?
