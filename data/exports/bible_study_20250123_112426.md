## Daily Verses
> James 1:5

  If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him.
*â€” James 1:5 (ESV)*

**Devotional on James 1:5**

**Brief Explanation:**

James 1:5 encourages us to seek wisdom from God when we face challenges or need guidance. Wisdom is the ability to apply knowledge and understanding to make sound judgments and decisions. God is the ultimate source of wisdom, and He generously grants it to those who ask.

**Life Application:**

When we encounter difficulties or uncertainties in life, it's tempting to rely on our own limited knowledge or the advice of others. However, God's wisdom surpasses all human understanding. By seeking His guidance, we can gain clarity, make better choices, and navigate life's complexities with confidence.

**Prayer Point:**

"Dear Heavenly Father,

I confess that I often lack wisdom in my life. I come to You today, humbly asking for Your guidance. Please grant me the wisdom I need to make wise decisions, discern Your will, and live a life that honors You.

In Jesus' name, Amen."
