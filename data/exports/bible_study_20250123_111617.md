## Biblical Perspective on Love

In the Bible, love is not merely an emotion or feeling but a fundamental attribute of God's character. 1 John 4:8 declares, "God is love." This means that love is not something that God possesses but is the very essence of who He is.

## Key Theological Points

* **God is the source of love:** As the initiator of love, God is the ultimate source from which all true love flows (1 John 4:8).
* **Love is the greatest commandment:** Jesus identified love as the greatest commandment, both for loving God and for loving others (Matthew 22:34-40).
* **Love is sacrificial:** True love is not self-serving but is willing to sacrifice for the well-being of others. Jesus exemplified this sacrificial love by laying down His life for us (John 15:13).

## Scripture References

* 1 John 4:8: "God is love."
* Matthew 22:34-40: "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself."
* John 15:13: "Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends."

## Practical Application

The biblical perspective on love has profound implications for our lives:

* **Love God first:** Since God is the source of love, we should prioritize our relationship with Him and seek to love Him with all our being.
* **Love others unconditionally:** Jesus' command to love our neighbors as ourselves extends to everyone, regardless of their differences or shortcomings.
* **Practice sacrificial love:** True love involves making sacrifices for the benefit of others, even when it is difficult or costly.
* **Seek God's love:** God's love is available to all who seek it. By drawing near to Him through prayer, worship, and obedience, we can experience the transformative power of His love in our lives.

## Daily Verses
> James 1:5

  If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him.
*â€” James 1:5 (ESV)*

**Devotional: Seek Wisdom from God**

**Brief Explanation:**

James 1:5 encourages us to seek wisdom from God when we face challenges or lack knowledge. God is the ultimate source of wisdom, and He freely gives it to those who ask.

**Life Application:**

In our daily lives, we often encounter situations where we need guidance and discernment. Instead of relying solely on our own limited understanding, we should turn to God for wisdom. He knows our hearts, our circumstances, and the best path forward.

When we ask God for wisdom, we acknowledge our dependence on Him. It humbles us and allows Him to lead us. Wisdom from God empowers us to make wise decisions, navigate complex challenges, and live according to His will.

**Prayer Point:**

Heavenly Father,

I come before you today, acknowledging my need for wisdom. I ask that You would generously grant me the wisdom I need to face the challenges of this day. Guide my steps, enlighten my mind, and help me to make decisions that honor You.

In Jesus' name, Amen.
